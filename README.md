Since there are no a single official WebSocket library for NodeMCU with ESP8266 module, I decided to create this repository to help anyone who struggled with the topic. Actually, there are a lot of open-source projects which created the WebSocket library but i have tried several of them and not all of them are reliable (I don't know whether it is my skill issue or what) but I eventually find one that works fine for my module.

The module used for this implementation : ESP-12E, Model ESP8266MOD, ISM 2.4GHz with CH340C driver, NodeMCU V3
